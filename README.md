# Hckr-News Display for iPad and co

Just a little web-app, which displays random top stories fetched from the hckr-news api. I made this, so I can have this website opened on my iPad next to me while I'm coding.

There isn't a whole lot of functionality, but it serves the purpose. Feel free to use it, asweel :)
